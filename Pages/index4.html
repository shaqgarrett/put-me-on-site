                <h5>Technology Support Specialist II</h5>  
                <p>
                    The purpose of creating this site is to highlight resources for people without a degree, people needing a career change, or people generally interested in how to break into the IT field. This was inspired by my own personal first-hand journey of getting into the tech industry. I was previously a college dropout moving from sales job to sales job without a clear-cut plan I wanted for myself. I only cared about making the most money. 2019, I unexpectedly lost my job and landed on my feet doing customer service for Wells Fargo. 
                    That was one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had but without that experience, I wouldn’t be where I am today. <br><br>The pandemic happened and I knew I had to do something better with my life, so I started researching certifications for IT. I came across the CompTIA A+ and then I bought all the study materials for it. In December 2020 I became certified. In March 2021 I was able to leave Wells Fargo and get my first tech job, but it was still more customer service related. On May 6th that job unexpectedly fired me, On May 7th I got the news that I was accepted back into school to finish my degree. On June 7th I got my first full tech support job working with DHEC. 
                    On August 9th I began working at Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina as a contractor. I began to work hard and pick up the job quickly, and as of April 11, 2022, I was hired on and promoted to Tech II. A position that requires a degree or 4 years of experience, and I have neither. Now I’m a mentor and a point of contact for other techs. Take it from me as an example, you can achieve the things you want in life, with hard work and dedication.
