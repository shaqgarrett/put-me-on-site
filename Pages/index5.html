        <h2>Job Interview Tips</h2> 
            <p> The interviews themselves could be a traditional job interview or a technical interview. The technical interview will still have the traditional “tell us about yourself?” type questions, 
                but they will also have questions to test your troubleshooting abilities. These could be questions about your previous experience with Active Directory, 
                what you would do if someone is experiencing internet issues, etc. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/education/professional-development/tech-job-interview-tips/" target="_blank">More interview tips!</a> </p> 
            <p><img src="../Images/jobinterview.webp" alt="Job Interview Graphic" width="600px" height="300px"></p> 
            <p>To further prepare for an interview, it is recommended to research the company. For my DHEC job, I was personally asked if I knew what their “values” were. 
                That was information that I had found on their website. Companies will appreciate that you took the time to research them, showing your eagerness to work for them. </p> 
            <p>Ask the interviewers questions. It is a job interview, so the questions go both ways. This is how you can gauge the culture of the company. Ask them when the last time a change was made from someone on the first level, 
                ask about their open-door policy and ask about their management styles. Given the world has changed since the pandemic, ask how they responded to the pandemic. </p> 
            <p>Lastly, be yourself. For Job interviews, most people are intimated by them. Don’t let the pressure of an interview get to you. Show a personality, don’t have to be robotic. I’ve received numerous compliments for simply showing a personality and being friendly. 
                If you don’t know the answers to some of the questions, don’t lie. The interviewers will be able to pick up on that. Instead, showcase your ability to learn quickly and your work ethic.</p>  
        <h2>Resume Tips</h2> 
            <p>With a <a href="https://www.hiration.com/blog/technical-resume-examples/" target="_blank">resume</a> whether you’re switching careers or have no experience, it’s best to highlight your customer services skills or any work you’ve done with a computer in the past. Even with no technical experience, 
                a job may take a chance given your customer service experience as this shows how personable you may be. </p> 
            <p>With a resume what makes them stand out is the keywords that are included. Due to a high number of applicants, most job postings have filters that will automatically throw out your resume if the keywords do not meet their requirements. So, if you never heard back from your job it may be because they never even seen your resume. 
                If you do have technical experience, be sure to take down every application that you’ve personally worked on.</p> 
            <p>There are also resume writing websites out there to help create your own resume.<a href="https://zety.com/" target="_blank">Zety</a> and <a href="https://www.jobscan.co/" target="_blank">Jobscan</a> are great examples! <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank">Fiverr</a> is a great resource to pay someone to create or revamp an existing resume. 
                I personally used Fiverr and I got more responses from jobs using that resume.</p> 
            <p>Lastly, network. Build relationships with different people. Sometimes the key to landing a job is not what you know, but who you know. I was able to get hired at DHEC and Blue Cross Blue Shield due to knowing someone that worked there, and they spoke to their manager for me. Once I my foot in the door, I kicked the door in with my work ethic as I knew that was someone taking a chance on me. 
                Utilize LinkedIn. Message the recruiters and hiring managers of different job postings and introduce yourself. This is another way to give yourself a leg up on the competition to potentially get hired. </p>
